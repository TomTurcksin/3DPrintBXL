<h2> How do I compare to other printing services </h2>
<p> For me, 3D printing and 3D design is a hobby. Because I invest a lot in my hobby, and because my printer is not working 24-7, I realised I should offer some services to others peoples, private and professionals alike. 
In this way I am able to create a second revenue while having a good time and making better use of my workshop. Browsing around on the internet, one quickely realises that 3D printing sevices are extremely expensive. </p>
<p> I am able to provide cheap services because: <ul>
<li> It is a second revenue. </li> 
<li> I have no employees to pay. </li>
<li> I only use freeware. </li>
<li> I leverage a dozen years of experice with the 3D softwares. </li> 
</ul> </p>
<p> The 3D-printing revolution promissed to be cheap and for everyone but sadely non of this is true. 
It is about time that the prices come down and the revolution everyone hoped for takes place. 
Unfortunatly, working with specialised companies with high overhead costs has proven to be to expensive. 
For that reason I believes that a friendly neighborhoud 3D printing service might actually be a good idea. </p>
