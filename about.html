<h2> Who am I?</h2>

<h2> How do I compare to other printing services? </h2>
<p> 3D design and printing is my hobby. Because I invest a lot in my hobby, and because my printer is not working 24-7, I realised I should offer some services to other people 
private and professionals alike. This way I can make better use of my workshop. Browsing around on the internet, one quickly realises that 3D printing services are extremely expensive. </p>
<p> I can provide affordable services because: <ul>
<li> This is my hobby </li> 
<li> I have little overhead </li>
<li> I only use freeware </li>
<li> I have over 10 years experience with 3D software </li> 
</ul> </p>
<p> The 3D-printing revolution promised to be cheap and for everyone but sadly this is not true. Unfortunately, working with specialised companies with high overhead costs has proven 
to be too expensive for private users. Therefore I believe that a friendly neighbourhood 3D printing service is a good idea.  </p>
