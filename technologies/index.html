<h2> Fused Deposition Printing   </h2>
<img src="../images/Cr10Max.png" alt="Picture from 3D printer" height="275" align="right"\>
<p> Fused Deposition Printers or FDPs are the most typical printers and are very familiar to hobbyists. For now, they have the best price/quality ratio. 
We have the Creality CR10Max that has been subjected to several upgrades (Octo-pi, flexible print bed etc.). This printer has a print volume of 450mm*450mm*470mm 
and is one of the largest available printers at this time (2020).</p>


<h3> Materials </h3> 
<p> This printer can support materials such as PLA, ABS and PET. Because the stock can become endless, I must limit my offer to the options listed below. </p>
<p> But first some general comments on the material types: 
<ul>
	<li>PLA is the preferred printing material. Many filaments are PLA based materials that take advantage of the good printing properties of PLA combining 
	it with some other properties, for example elastic materials; and fluorescent materials. In addition PLA is a polymere that can easily be recycled and in principle should dissolve in water.
	After testing this (leaving PLA in tap water for over a month) no degradation could be detected. I conclude that is is more resilient than some advertise.
	<!--	<ul>
		<li> Natural PLA: collor is white and a little bit opaque (0,05 € /gr).</li>
		<li> Collored PLA: White collor (0,05 € /gr).</li>
		<li> Collored PLA: Black Satin  (glassy straines give it a shiny look) (0,05 € /gr).</li>
		<li> Flexible PLA: This natural collerd PLA is mixed with elastomeres givving it a rubber like feeling. (0,10 € /gr).</li>	
		<li> Fluorecent PLA: This natural collerd PLA is mixed with fluorecent pigments thatproduces a green after glow for one or two minutes.(0,05 € /gr).</li> 
		</ul>    -->
	</li> 
	<li>ABS is advised in cases where the parts are used in a warmer environment +80°C. ABS requires higher print temperatures and is tougher on the printer than PLA.  
	<!--	<ul>
		<li> Collored ABS: White collor (0,05 € /gr).</li>
		</ul>  -->
	</li>
</ul>  
</p>

<script>
 printOutMaterials(materialPrices, materialDescriptions );
</script>
</p>

<p>
If a print is required in a different material, you are welcome to order a spool; any leftover material remains yours. There will then only be a
 <script> document.write(clientMaterialSwitch); </script> € charge for installing your spool. Please contact me before purchasing any material to ensure compatability.

 <h3> FDP Printing Price  </h3>  
<p>  <!-- The printing price decreases exponentially with time. It can be calculated with the following function:</p> 
<p> <?php // echo("( $priceCteA + $priceCteB*exp(- T [h] / $priceCteTau [h])) [€/h] ") ;  ?> </p> 
 <p>  
To find the printing price this funciton should be integrated over time leading to: </p>
 <p>   <?php //echo "($priceCteA * T  + $priceCteB * T * (1-exp(- T [h] / $priceCteTau [h] ))) [€] " ; ?> </p> <p>  These funtions are illustrated in the figures below for quick reference.
In addition the fillament cost should be added. </p> -->




Because every print is unique, the project must be well defined before an offer can be made. The listed <a href="../examples/index.html">examples</a> 
can give you a feeling for the cost of a particular print job. The printing cost decreases exponentially with time. Integrating the printing cost over time leads to the following equation: 

<!--Based on the .stl files, a price for a particular print can be requested through the <a href="../requestPrintPrice.php">request print form </a>.  
The caculator hereunder computes the price of a print based on the material-type, material amount and print time. 
These variables are estimated by the slicer software, but they strongly depend on the slicer settings. The most important settings to adapte in your slicer (assuming natural PLA) are 
<b> a layer height, of 0.2[mm] </b> and a <b> print speed of 400[mm/min]. This calculator can thus be used for a price estimation without costs attributed to shipping, 
design or support removal.</b>
The printing cost decreases exponentially with time. Integrating the printing cost over time leads to following equation:  --> 
</p> <p class="tabbed">

 (<script> document.write(priceCteA);</script> * T  + <script> document.write(priceCteB);</script>  * T * (1-exp(- T [h] / <script> document.write(priceCteTau);</script>  [h]))) €   

</p> <p>
To the cost for printing, design and cost should be added, as well as support removal and shipment cost.

<h3> Materials </h3> 
<p> The materials this printer can support include PLA, PET and ABS. Because the stock can become endless, I onle provide in several options listed hereafter: 
<ul>
	<li>PLA: PLA is the preferred printing material. Many fillaments are PLA based materials that take advantage of the good printing properties of PLA and combine 
	it with some other properties for example elastic materials, and fluorecent materials. In addition PLA is an ploymere that can easily be recycled and in principle should desolve in water.
	After testing this (leaeving PLA for over a month in tap water) I could not see any degradation. So it is more resillient that some advertise.
		<ul>
		<li> Natural PLA: collor is white and a little bit opaque (0,05 € /gr).</li>
		<li> Collored PLA: White collor (0,05 € /gr).</li>
		<li> Collored PLA: Black Satin  (glassy straines give it a shiny look) (0,05 € /gr).</li>
		<li> Flexible PLA: This natural collerd PLA is mixed with elastomeres givving it a rubber like feeling. (0,10 € /gr).</li>	
		<li> Fluorecent PLA: This natural collerd PLA is mixed with fluorecent pigments thatproduces a green after glow for one or two minutes.(0,05 € /gr).</li> 
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>ABS: ABS is adviced for cases where the parts are used in a warmer environement +80°C. ABS requires higher print temperatres and harsher on the printed than PLA.  
		<ul>
		<li> Collored ABS: White collor (0,05 € /gr).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>  
</p>
<p>
If a print is required in a different material, the client is welcome to order a spool, the leftover material belongs to the client. No material costs will be 
charged but 5 € for installing the client spool will be charged. Please contact me before purchasing any material though.
</p>
 <h3> FDP Printing Price </h3> 
<p> The printing price decreases exponentially with time. It can be calculated with the following function:</p> 
<p> <?php //echo"( $priceCteA + 0,5.exp(- T [h] / 24 [h])). [€/h]" ?> </p> <p>  
To find the printing price this funciton should be integrated over time leading to: </p>
 <p>   (0,5 . T  + 0,5 . T . (1-exp(- T [h] / 24 [h] ) )).[€] </p> <p>  These funtions are illustrated in the figures below for quick reference.
In addition the fillament cost should be added. Because every print is unique, it is impossible to set a price beforehand. The listed examples can give you some feeling of the cost of particular print job.
Also based on the .stl files, a price for a particular print can be requested through the <a href="../requestPrintPrice.html">request print form </a>. </p>
