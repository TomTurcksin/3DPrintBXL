<h2> Bicycle support project </h2>
<p> This project addresses an issue that several of my friends and myself seems to have. A bicycle takes a lot of space. 
It is possible to hang them up to the ceiling however I could not find a system that suited me. This project was interesting as one of my bikes has a mass of 15 kg. 
So these parts need to endure high stresses in order to support the bikes. The hook providing the connection with the ceiling are of type M5. Metal is obviously several times stronger. 
All wheels are supported with 7*22 mm ball bearings of which I have a large stock. This allows for smooth operation. There are two cables for each bike. 
At first the two cables were connected together. The required force to pull the bikes up was much higher than what I expected. So I choose to use two locking mechanisms per bike. 
The system is operational for quite a while now and works fine. The print material is natural PLA with an infill density of 80% for the critical parts. 
After working out the difficulties w.rt. the forces and ensuring smooth operation, I have printed the same system for another client who seems to be happy with it.</p>

<p>
It should be pointed out that with some goodwill, the costs for the support material removal can easily be saved. 
See the homepage for more information on this topic. The part was quite complicated and therefore the design costs are quite high. 
The actual printing costs only amounts to 45,0 €. The unprocessed part is available to other customers for reprints at 1,5 times the actual printing cost or 51,9 €. 
The processed part (support removal) is available for the printing cost plus support removal or 93,0 €. 
A pack containing all processed parts, screws and bolts, 12 m of rope, all bearings (the whole set for 1 bicycle) is available for 110 €.
